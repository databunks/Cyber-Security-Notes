It is vital to administrate and correctly define the various levels of access to an information technology system individuals require.Â 

The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:

-   The individual's ==role/function== within the organisation
-   The ==sensitivity== of the information being stored on the system

==Two key concepts== are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals, two key concepts are used: `Privileged Identity Management` (PIM) and `Privileged Access Management` (or PAM for short).

Initially, these two concepts can seem to overlap; however, they are different from one another. `PIM` is used to ==translate a user's role== within an ==organisation== into an ==access role== on a ==system==. Whereas `PAM` is the management of the privileges a ==system's access role== has, amongst other things.

What is essential when discussing privilege and access controls is the principle of least privilege. Simply, users should be given the minimum amount of privileges, and only those that are ==absolutely necessary== for them to perform their duties. Other people should be able to trust what people write to.

As we previously mentioned, `PAM` incorporates more than assigning access. It also encompasses enforcing security policies such as password management, auditing policies and reducing the attack surface a system faces.
