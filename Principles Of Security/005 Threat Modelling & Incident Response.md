==Threat modelling== is the process of ==reviewing==, ==improving==, and ==testing== the security protocols in place in an organisation's information technology infrastructure and services.

A critical stage of the threat modelling process is identifying likely threats that an application or system may face, the ==vulnerabilities== a system or application may be vulnerable to.

The threat modelling process is very similar to a risk assessment made in workplaces for employees and customers. The principles all return to:

-   Preparation
-   Identification
-   Mitigations
-   Review

It is, however, a complex process that needs constant review and discussion with a dedicated team. An effective threat model includes:

-   Threat intelligence
-   Asset identification
-   Mitigation capabilities
-   Risk assessment

To help with this, there are frameworks such as ==**STRIDE**== :

- **S**poofing identity 

- **T**ampering with data

- **R**epudiation threats (This principle dictates the use of services such as logging of activity for a system or application to track.)

- **I**nformation disclosure (Applications or services that handle information of multiple users need to be appropriately configured to only show information relevant to the owner is shown)

- **D**enial of Service

- **E**levation of privileges

and ==**PASTA**==  **P**rocess for **A**ttack **S**imulation and **T**hreat **A**nalysis) infosec never tasted so good!. 


A ==breach of security== is known as an ==incident==. And despite all rigorous threat models and secure system designs, incidents do happen. Actions taken to resolve and remediate the threat are known as ==Incident Response== (IR) and are a whole career path in cybersecurity.

Incidents are classified using a ==rating== of urgency and impact. Urgency will be determined by the ==type of attack== faced, where the impact will be determined by the ==affected system== and what impact that has on business operations.

An ==incident== is responded to by a **C**omputer **S**ecurity **I**ncident **R**esponse **T**eam (**CSIRT**) which is prearranged group of employees with technical knowledge about the systems and/or current incident. To successfully solve an incident, these steps are often referred to as the six phases of Incident Response that takes place, listed in the table below:

**Preparation**

Do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with the security incident?

**Identification**

Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to?

**Containment

Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted?

**Eradication

Remove the active threat.

**RecoveryÂ 

Perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to business as usual operations.

**Lessons Learned

What can be learnt from the incident? I.e. if it was due to a phishing email, employees should be trained better to detect phishing emails.
