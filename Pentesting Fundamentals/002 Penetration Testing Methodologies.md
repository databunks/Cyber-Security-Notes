**Penetration tests** can have a wide variety of objectives and targets within scope. Because of this, ==no penetration test is the same==, and there are no one-case fits all as to how a penetration tester should approach it. 

The steps a penetration tester takes during an engagement is known as the `methodology`. A practical methodology is a ==smart one==, where the steps taken are ==relevant== to the situation at hand. For example, having a methodology that you would use to test the security of a `web application` is not practical when you have to test the `security` of a network.

Before discussing some different industry-standard methodologies, we should note that all of them have a general theme of the following stages:


<h2 style="text-align:center;"> Information Gathering </h1>
This stage involves ==collecting== as much ==publically accessible== information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.

**Note:** This does not involve scanning any systems.

<h2 style="text-align:center">Enumeration/Scanning</h2>
This stage involves ==discovering== `applications` and `services` running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.

<h2 style="text-align:center">Exploitation</h2>
This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.

<h2 style="text-align:center">Privilege Escalation</h2>
Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to ==expand your access to a system==. You can escalate `horizontally` and `vertically`, where horizontally is accessing another account of the ==same permission group== (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of ==another permission group== (i.e. an administrator).

<h2 style="text-align:center">Post-exploitation</h2>
This stage involves a few sub-stages:  

**1.** What ==other== hosts can be targeted (pivoting)

**2.** What ==additional information== can we gather ==from the host== now that we are a privileged user

**3.** Covering your tracks

**4.** Reporting


<h2 style="text-align:center">Pentesting frameworks</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center">OSSTMM</h2>
[The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.

The methodology focuses primarily on how these systems, applications communicate, so it includes a methodology for:

1.  elecommunications (phones, VoIP, etc.)
2.  Wired Networks
3.  Wireless communications

<h2 style="text-align:center">OWASP</h2>
The "[Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/)" framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of ==web applications and services==.

The foundation regularly [writes reports](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/) stating the top ten security vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing approach, and remediation.

<h2 style="text-align:center">NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1</h2>
The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) is a popular framework used to improve an organisations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. This framework is a bit of an honourable mention because of its popularity and detail.

The framework provides guidelines on security controls & benchmarks for success for organisations from ==critical infrastructure== (power plants, etc.) all through to commercial.Â  There is a limited section on a standard guideline for the methodology a penetration tester should take.

<h2 style="text-align:center">NCSC CAF</h2>
The [Cyber Assessment Framework](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/caf/caf-principles-and-guidance) (CAF) is an extensive framework of fourteen principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organisation's defences against these.

  
The framework applies to organisations considered to perform "vitally important services and activities" such as critical infrastructure, banking, and the likes. The framework mainly focuses on and assesses the following topics:

-   Data security
-   System security
-   Identity and access control
-   Resiliency
-   Monitoring
-   Response and recovery planning
